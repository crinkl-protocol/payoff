      "topic": "Deterministic vs. probabilistic signal gap",
      "insight": "The ad industry pays $5+ CPM for probabilistic purchase inference; a cryptographically verified receipt confirms a transaction actually occurred — a distinction that makes every receipt-level signal structurally more valuable than anything currently traded on open exchanges.",
      "magnitude": "high"

    {
      "topic": "Cookie deprecation creates unpriced inventory",
      "insight": "With Chrome completing cookie deprecation and fingerprinting increasingly blocked by regulation, the $198K GMV already captured in verified receipts represents a class of purchase signal that has no direct substitute in the current cookieless stack.",
      "magnitude": "high"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Platform silo vulnerability",
      "insight": "Visa sees merchant category codes but not product names; Amazon sees its own orders but not Shopify or Costco; no single platform sees cross-ecosystem, product-level purchase behavior — which is precisely what receipt-level aggregation produces.",
      "magnitude": "high"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Competitive intelligence asymmetry",
      "insight": "Brands that query the receipt dataset can see competitor overlap and stack combinations; brands that don't still have their receipts in the dataset — they're simply the only party not looking at the intelligence.",

      "topic": "DKIM as accidental verification infrastructure",
      "insight": "DKIM email authentication, built to stop spoofing, incidentally makes every vendor receipt email cryptographically verifiable — Anthropic, OpenAI, Stripe, Amazon, and others have already signed their receipts without designing them as commerce signals.",

    {
      "topic": "Market price for receipt data is unestablished",
      "insight": "Credit card transaction data sells to hedge funds at $10M+/year but is identity-attached and lacks product-level detail; the receipt protocol has no active predicate queries yet, meaning the first brand to transact will set the reference price for a signal category that doesn't exist elsewhere.",
