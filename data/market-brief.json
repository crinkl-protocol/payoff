      "topic": "Deterministic vs. probabilistic signal gap",
      "insight": "The ad industry pays $5+ CPM for probabilistic signals inferred from browsing behavior; a cryptographically verified receipt confirms a purchase actually occurred. That gap — inference versus proof — is the pricing arbitrage every cookieless targeting alternative is trying to close, and most aren't close.",
      "magnitude": "high"

    {
      "topic": "Cookie deprecation leaves no clean replacement",
      "insight": "Chrome's deprecation joins Safari and Firefox, and the fallback options — device fingerprinting, data brokers, first-party data — each cover one slice of the customer journey with known accuracy problems. No single replacement replicates cross-ecosystem, product-level purchase visibility.",
      "magnitude": "high"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Platform silos are structural, not fixable",
      "insight": "Google sees search intent but not physical receipts; Visa sees payment amounts but not product detail; Apple locks its data inside its ecosystem. These companies will not combine their datasets — the competitive incentive runs the other way — which means cross-ecosystem purchase signals can only come from a layer that sits outside all of them.",
      "magnitude": "high"

    {
      "topic": "Closed-loop receipt data is real but inaccessible",
      "insight": "Fetch Rewards ($240M raised) and Ibotta (IPO'd at $2.7B) validated that receipt data is commercially valuable, but both are identity-attached and closed to third-party queries. The market for open, identity-free receipt data hasn't been priced yet.",

    {
      "topic": "First predicate activation is the watch signal",
      "insight": "Zero brand predicates have been activated against this dataset, meaning the commerce query layer hasn't opened yet; when that number moves from 0 to 1, it confirms brands are paying to interrogate verified purchase data — the signal that the market is real, not theoretical.",
      "magnitude": "high"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Identity-free architecture changes the compliance calculus",
      "insight": "GDPR, CCPA, and state privacy laws have made identity-attached datasets a legal liability; a verified purchase signal with no personal identifier attached carries no consent burden and no breach exposure, which is a structural cost advantage over broker data that regulators are actively pressuring.",
