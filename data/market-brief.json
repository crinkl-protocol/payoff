      "topic": "Deterministic vs. probabilistic signal value",
      "insight": "Verified purchase receipts confirm a transaction occurred — they are not inferences. The ad industry pays $5+ CPM for probabilistic signals built on browsing behavior; a cryptographically verified receipt represents a higher-quality signal with no equivalent market price yet established.",

    {
      "topic": "Cookie deprecation leaves a verified-purchase gap",
      "insight": "Chrome's third-party cookie deprecation eliminates the primary cross-site tracking primitive, and no major platform replacement produces identity-free, cross-ecosystem, product-level purchase confirmation. The gap between what first-party data covers and what actually happens in commerce is structural, not temporary.",
      "magnitude": "high"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Platform silos as a durable blind spot",
      "insight": "Google sees search intent, Visa sees merchant category codes, Amazon sees its own orders — none see across each other's walls. A dataset aggregated across ecosystems without identity attachment creates an information position no single platform can replicate internally.",
      "magnitude": "high"
    },
    {
      "topic": "DKIM as accidental verification infrastructure",
      "insight": "DKIM email signatures, built to prevent spoofing, are cryptographic proof that a receipt email is real, unmodified, and from the actual vendor's mail server. This existing infrastructure — already deployed by Anthropic, OpenAI, Stripe, Amazon, and others — is the technical primitive enabling purchase verification without a proprietary data pipeline.",

      "topic": "Shopper marketing measurement remains largely unresolved",
      "insight": "CPG and retail brands spend over $200 billion annually on trade promotion and shopper marketing, with most of it unmeasured at the product-purchase level. Verified receipt data at scale would be the first mechanism to close that measurement gap across retailers rather than within a single closed loyalty program.",
      "magnitude": "high"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Participation game theory favors early movers",
      "insight": "Brands that query the receipt dataset gain visibility into competitor overlap and consumer stack behavior; brands that abstain still contribute their customers' receipts to the pool without access to others'. The structure of the dataset creates a dominant strategy to participate early, before query pricing is established by active market use.",
