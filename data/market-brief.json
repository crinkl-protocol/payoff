      "topic": "Deterministic vs. probabilistic signal gap",
      "insight": "The ad industry pays $5+ CPM for probabilistic signals inferred from browsing behavior. A cryptographically verified receipt — proof a transaction occurred, not a guess that it might — is a categorically different asset that current ad tech cannot produce.",

      "topic": "Cookie deprecation leaves no clean replacement",
      "insight": "Chrome's third-party cookie deprecation completes what Safari and Firefox started; device fingerprinting is degrading under privacy regulation; data brokers face shrinking utility under GDPR and CCPA. No dominant cookieless targeting primitive has emerged to replace them.",

      "topic": "Platform silos blind every major data holder",
      "insight": "Google sees search and Gmail but no physical receipts; Visa sees merchant category codes but not product-level detail; Amazon sees its own orders but nothing from Shopify or Costco. Every platform's data is valuable inside its walls and structurally blind outside them.",

    {
      "topic": "DKIM as accidental verification infrastructure",
      "insight": "DKIM email authentication — built to stop spoofing — doubles as cryptographic proof that a vendor receipt is real, unmodified, and from the actual sender's mail server. The verification primitive already exists across SaaS and e-commerce vendors; it was not being applied to commerce intelligence until now.",

      "topic": "Competitive intelligence asymmetry for brands",
      "insight": "Brands that query a shared verified-receipt dataset can see competitor overlap, cross-stack purchase patterns, and retention signals. Brands that opt out remain visible in the dataset but lose the ability to see anyone else — creating a dominant strategy to participate regardless of coordination.",

      "topic": "No established price for verified purchase signals",
      "insight": "Credit card transaction data sells to hedge funds at $10M+ annually but is identity-attached and not product-level. Verified, identity-free, cross-ecosystem purchase signals have no current market price — the first active predicate queries will set the reference price for a category that does not yet have one.",
