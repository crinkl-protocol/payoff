      "topic": "Deterministic vs. probabilistic signal cost",
      "insight": "Ad tech charges $5–$150 CPA for modeled attribution; DKIM-verified receipts settle at roughly $0.10 each — a 50–200x cost delta that isn't incremental improvement, it's a different category of signal entirely.",
      "magnitude": "high"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Post-cookie targeting gap",
      "insight": "With Chrome completing cookie deprecation and fingerprinting under regulatory pressure, the ad stack is left with first-party data that goes blind at the edge of each brand's own ecosystem — verified receipt infrastructure fills exactly that gap without requiring identity attachment.",
      "magnitude": "high"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Physical retail signal emergence",
      "insight": "Best Buy's appearance as a top brand in the dataset marks the first major brick-and-mortar chain captured, signaling the protocol now reaches physical spend — higher average tickets, broader category diversity — that digital-only attribution methods structurally cannot see.",
      "magnitude": "high"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Identity-free architecture as compliance advantage",
      "insight": "DKIM verification proves a purchase occurred without attaching a consumer identity, which removes the primary legal liability that makes sharing credit card and receipt-scanning data (Fetch, Ibotta) across ecosystems legally untenable under GDPR and CCPA.",
      "magnitude": "high"

    {
      "topic": "Geographic diffusion into non-metro markets",
      "insight": "Active coverage expanded 29% in a single snapshot window, now spanning 24 metros plus rural state-level designations — a reach profile that matters for CPG and mass-market brands whose volume lives outside major urban DMAs.",
      "magnitude": "medium"
    },
    {
      "topic": "Platform silo blind spots",
      "insight": "A Best Buy receipt processed through Gmail's DKIM infrastructure is simultaneously invisible to Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft — the cross-ecosystem purchase signal that no single platform can produce is precisely what this layer captures.",
