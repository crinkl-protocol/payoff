      "observation": "Best Buy entered the top brand list this snapshot — the first major physical retail chain to appear. At $206K GMV and 3,555 receipts, this signals the receipt layer is capturing brick-and-mortar spend alongside SaaS/digital."

The pulse amplitude continues escalating — this burst matches the prior 9-CBSA event in magnitude."
