      "observation": "Token velocity ticked up to 0.695x (from 0.665x) with acceleration at 1.007x — the second consecutive snapshot above 1.0x acceleration, confirming the plateau has broken. Combined with 2 new receipts, 7d GMV up $743 ($30,178→$30,922), and 1 new LN payout, the supply and settlement sides are both moving."

      "observation": "One new CBSA (non-metro US-TN) appeared this snapshot, bringing active metros to 23. After the 9-CBSA burst last snapshot, the pulse has gone quiet — consistent with the observed pattern of burst then silence before the next wave."

Combined with 19 new receipts in the window (3493→3512) and the 9-CBSA geographic burst, this snapshot shows the first simultaneous supply-side and demand-side acceleration since the quiet period started."

The pulse sequence has been: 3 → 6 → 0 → 0 → 0 → 1 → 9, suggesting an accelerating burst pattern rather than steady-state growth."

      "observation": "Token acceleration ticked back to 0.999x (from 1.003x last snapshot) while velocity holds at 0.665x — the brief acceleration signal may not be sustained, but the plateau has not resumed either. The pipeline is in a transitional zone: not flat, not clearly recovering."

The pipeline is processing receipts without geographic or vendor expansion, suggesting existing nodes are deepening rather than spreading."

This may signal the end of the sustained plateau, though the move is small and needs confirmation across 2-3 more snapshots."

This is now a confirmed sustained plateau: the pipeline is holding steady without growth or decline, distinct from the prior deceleration phase. Repeat payout ratio at 9% confirms existing wallets remain active even as new intake has stalled."

Repeat payout ratio at 9% confirms existing wallets remain active even as new intake has stalled."
