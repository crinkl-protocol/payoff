The frontier has demand but zero activations. Infrastructure/DevOps vendors dominate the request queue, suggesting the early adopter base skews heavily toward developers."

The burst-then-silence pattern is repeating: the system loads, fires, then goes quiet before the next wave. The question is whether the next burst will exceed 9 or revert toward the prior pattern of 3-6."

The plateau break has not reversed but also has not accelerated; the system appears to be in a stable, low-growth equilibrium rather than a recovery trajectory."
