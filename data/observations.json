      "observation": "Token acceleration ticked back to 0.999x (from 1.003x last snapshot) while velocity holds at 0.665x — the brief acceleration signal may not be sustained, but the plateau has not resumed either. The pipeline is in a transitional zone: not flat, not clearly recovering."

      "observation": "A new CBSA appeared this snapshot — non-metro US-ME — bringing active metro count to 13 and geo-diffusion rate to 7.7%. This is the first new CBSA after multiple consecutive zero-new-CBSA snapshots, suggesting the pulse pattern may be resuming after the quiet window."

      "observation": "Zero new CBSAs, zero new vendors, zero settlement velocity in a 3.1h window — but GMV ticked up $350 (3488→3490 receipts) and 14d distribution window also expanded. The pipeline is processing receipts without geographic or vendor expansion, suggesting existing nodes are deepening rather than spreading."

This may signal the end of the sustained plateau, though the move is small and needs confirmation across 2-3 more snapshots."

This is now a confirmed sustained plateau: the pipeline is holding steady without growth or decline, distinct from the prior deceleration phase. Repeat payout ratio at 9% confirms existing wallets remain active even as new intake has stalled."
