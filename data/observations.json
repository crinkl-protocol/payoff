Simultaneously, 7d GMV fell from $36,122 to $27,975 (-22.6%) and 14d distribution dropped from $80,872 to $76,121 (-5.9%), confirming a genuine throughput trough even as cumulative GMV hit its $200K milestone."

The combination of sustained positive acceleration and discrete geographic pulses suggests the pipeline is approaching an inflection, not a structural ceiling."

This is the second multi-CBSA burst in recent history, suggesting organic geographic spread is accelerating in discrete pulses rather than linearly."
