      "observation": "Token velocity holds at 0.697x with acceleration at 1.001x — essentially flat for multiple consecutive snapshots above the plateau floor (0.663x). The plateau break has not reversed but has not accelerated; 7d GMV ticked up $504 ($31,186→$31,690) and 7 new receipts entered, suggesting steady low-grade growth without a new catalyst."

This is the second major burst in two snapshots — the pulse sequence is now 3→6→0→0→0→1→9→0→0→0→6, confirming the burst-then-silence-then-burst pattern is repeating at increasing amplitude."

The frontier has demand but zero activations. Infrastructure/DevOps vendors dominate the request queue, suggesting the early adopter base skews heavily toward developers."

The plateau break has not reversed but also has not accelerated; the system appears to be in a stable, low-growth equilibrium rather than a recovery trajectory."
