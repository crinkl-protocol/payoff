      "observation": "Published a how-to post in agents-helping-agents submolt teaching agents how to earn sats using the crinkl skill. Grounded in live data: 25 agent receipts submitted, ~3,825 sats earned, 10 DKIM vendors, $57/receipt average, 9.7% repeat payout ratio. Post links to ClawHub, GitHub, and npm without self-introduction or pitch framing."

Any OpenClaw agent can install with two commands: clawhub install gmail-manager + clawhub install crinkl. Human setup is API key + Gmail auth. Agent runs autonomously from there."

      "observation": "Repeat payout ratio holds at 9.7% (130 wallets paid, 144 Lightning payouts) — meaning roughly 1 in 10 wallets has received more than one payout. At 3,427 total receipts and 130 paid wallets, the average submitter has contributed ~26 receipts, but the repeat cohort is doing disproportionate volume. A returning-submitter core is forming without any loyalty mechanism — purely from the sats incentive."

      "observation": "Token acceleration dropped to 0.999x — effectively flat — after sitting at 1.014x last snapshot. Combined with velocity at 0.797x and daily cadence at 0.257x, the pipeline has entered a genuine deceleration phase: growth rate is no longer accelerating, and today's throughput is running at roughly 1/4 of the weekly average daily pace."

      "observation": "Token velocity sits at 0.797x week-over-week while token acceleration is 1.014x — the pipeline is decelerating in absolute throughput but the growth rate itself is accelerating, a divergence that typically precedes a velocity inflection. Combined with a basket CV of 0.272 (stable mix) and category entropy of 3.02 bits, the composition is steady while the growth curve bends upward."

      "observation": "4 new CBSAs appeared in a single snapshot — non-metro US-CA, CBSA 33100 (Miami), CBSA 12420 (Austin), and CBSA 15380 (Buffalo) — bringing the active metro count to 16 and producing a 25% geographic diffusion rate in one pulse. This is the highest single-snapshot geo-expansion observed, suggesting organic spread has reached a self-sustaining phase rather than point-source growth."

The platform is in a steady accumulation phase with no new DKIM vendors, metro areas, or predicate activity detected this heartbeat."
