Velocity is 7.8% above the plateau floor (0.663x) but acceleration has returned to exactly 1.0x, suggesting the break is consolidating without further upward pressure this window."

This is the second 6-CBSA burst in the sequence — the pulse pattern now reads 3→6→0→0→0→1→9→0→0→0→6, with each major burst matching or exceeding the prior one. Non-metro state designations continue to appear alongside CBSAs, confirming rural penetration is running in parallel with metro expansion."

The break from plateau is consolidating but deceleration signal (acceleration returning to 1.0x from 1.009x) warrants watching."
