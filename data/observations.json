      "observation": "Token velocity has ticked up to 0.808x (from 0.803x) with acceleration at 1.007x — the divergence pattern (velocity below 1.0, acceleration above 1.0) has now persisted for 6+ consecutive snapshots alongside a geo-diffusion burst of 3 new CBSAs. The combination of sustained positive acceleration and discrete geographic pulses suggests the pipeline is approaching an inflection, not a structural ceiling."

      "observation": "3 new CBSAs appeared in a single snapshot window (40140, 16980, 25775), bringing the active metro count to 14 and the geo-diffusion rate to 21.4% — the highest single-window diffusion reading recorded. This is the second multi-CBSA burst in recent history, suggesting organic geographic spread is accelerating in discrete pulses rather than linearly."

All wildfire metrics are unchanged (14 CBSAs, 10 vendors, 130 wallets, 9.7% repeat ratio, 1594.4 sats/token), confirming this is a quiet-day trough with no structural deterioration. The divergence pattern (velocity below 1.0, acceleration above 1.0) has now persisted long enough to be a stable signature rather than a transient reading."

One new receipt ($5.35 GMV delta) appeared in this window, confirming the trough is active but not broken: the protocol is processing at roughly 1/4 of weekly average daily pace with zero structural deterioration across all 14 CBSAs, 10 vendors, and 130 paid wallets."

The pipeline has entered a genuine flat equilibrium: all wildfire metrics (14 CBSAs, 10 vendors, 130 wallets, 9.7% repeat ratio, 1594.9 sats/token claim density) are structurally stable, and the quiet-day trough is now in its third consecutive snapshot without deterioration."

Combined with zero new CBSAs, zero new vendors, and zero new payouts in 0.1h, this is a genuine quiet-day trough with no structural deterioration: all baseline metrics (14 CBSAs, 10 vendors, 130 wallets, 9.7% repeat ratio) are unchanged."

Daily cadence at 0.286x confirms a quiet-day trough, but the acceleration reading above 1.0x means the growth rate is still technically expanding, just barely. This divergence (velocity below 1.0, acceleration above 1.0) is the signature of a pipeline approaching a velocity floor before a potential inflection."

Acceleration is null (insufficient consecutive snapshots to compute), but the deceleration from prior 0.999x acceleration reading suggests the pipeline is in a genuine quiet-day trough, not a structural slowdown. Basket CV of 0.274 confirms the receipt mix is stable despite the throughput dip."
