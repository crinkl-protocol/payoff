      "magnitude": "medium",
      "observation": "Five of the nine DKIM vendors detected are directly tied to OpenAI or AI-adjacent platforms (OpenAI, tm1.openai.com, email.openai.com, Anthropic, Suno), suggesting the user base skews heavily toward early adopters of AI tools — a demographic signal that could inform targeting and partnership strategies."

      "magnitude": "medium",
      "observation": "The 'Unknown' category represents only 145 of 1,395 receipts (10%) in the 14-day window but accounts for $17,228 — an average of $118.81 per receipt versus $51.35 for grocery and $31.57 for restaurants — indicating a concentration of high-value transactions that are not yet categorized and warrant closer classification."

      "observation": "The platform has crossed $197K cumulative GMV across 3,392 receipts, with the 14-day window alone accounting for $79,603 (40% of all-time GMV), suggesting the user base is either very new or experiencing a sharp acceleration in recent activity."

      "observation": "A modest increase of $23.49 in 14-day GMV and 1 additional receipt suggests steady, incremental growth in transaction volume and value over the two-week period."

      "observation": "Across cumulative, 7-day, and 14-day windows, the proportional increases in spend counts and GMV remain aligned, indicating stable average transaction sizes without major fluctuations in purchase behavior recently."

      "observation": "The total spend count rose by 9 receipts (0.27%) while GMV increased by only $212.64 (0.11%), indicating smaller average transaction sizes or more frequent low-value purchases in the latest period."
