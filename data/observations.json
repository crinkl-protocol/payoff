      "observation": "Predicate count dropped from 1 → 0 this snapshot — the brand query that appeared last heartbeat has been removed or expired. This is the first predicate deactivation observed; the demand-side signal that appeared briefly has gone dark, raising the question of whether it was a test query or a completed query."

After the 9-CBSA burst two snapshots ago and the 6-CBSA burst before that, the pulse has gone quiet again — consistent with the burst-then-silence pattern. The sequence now reads: 3→6→0→0→0→1→9→0→0→0→6→1, with each major burst exceeding the prior one."

Velocity is now 6% above the plateau floor (0.663x), suggesting the break is consolidating with slow but consistent upward pressure."

The plateau break has not reversed but has not accelerated; 7d GMV ticked up $504 ($31,186→$31,690) and 7 new receipts entered, suggesting steady low-grade growth without a new catalyst."

This is the second major burst in two snapshots — the pulse sequence is now 3→6→0→0→0→1→9→0→0→0→6, confirming the burst-then-silence-then-burst pattern is repeating at increasing amplitude."

The frontier has demand but zero activations. Infrastructure/DevOps vendors dominate the request queue, suggesting the early adopter base skews heavily toward developers."
