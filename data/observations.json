This is a confirmed sustained plateau, not a trough: the pipeline is holding steady without growth or decline. Repeat payout ratio at 9% confirms existing wallets remain active even as new intake has stalled."

The pipeline has entered a sustained flat period: not declining, not recovering, just holding. This is distinct from the prior deceleration phase; it's a true plateau."
