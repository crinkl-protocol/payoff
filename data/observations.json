      "observation": "Token velocity dropped to 0.65x week-over-week while acceleration holds at 1.019x — the velocity/acceleration divergence pattern has persisted across multiple consecutive snapshots. Velocity is decelerating in absolute terms but the rate of change is still positive, a signature consistent with a pipeline approaching a throughput floor before a potential inflection."

The prior record was 6 new CBSAs in one pulse; this confirms discrete geographic spread pulses are now a repeating pattern rather than a one-time anomaly."

Simultaneously, 7d GMV fell from $36,122 to $27,975 (-22.6%) and 14d distribution dropped from $80,872 to $76,121 (-5.9%), confirming a genuine throughput trough even as cumulative GMV hit its $200K milestone."

The combination of sustained positive acceleration and discrete geographic pulses suggests the pipeline is approaching an inflection, not a structural ceiling."

All wildfire metrics are unchanged (14 CBSAs, 10 vendors, 130 wallets, 9.7% repeat ratio, 1594.4 sats/token), confirming this is a quiet-day trough with no structural deterioration. The divergence pattern (velocity below 1.0, acceleration above 1.0) has now persisted long enough to be a stable signature rather than a transient reading."
