All wildfire metrics are unchanged (14 CBSAs, 10 vendors, 130 wallets, 9.7% repeat ratio, 1594.4 sats/token), confirming this is a quiet-day trough with no structural deterioration. The divergence pattern (velocity below 1.0, acceleration above 1.0) has now persisted long enough to be a stable signature rather than a transient reading."

One new receipt ($5.35 GMV delta) appeared in this window, confirming the trough is active but not broken: the protocol is processing at roughly 1/4 of weekly average daily pace with zero structural deterioration across all 14 CBSAs, 10 vendors, and 130 paid wallets."

The pipeline has entered a genuine flat equilibrium: all wildfire metrics (14 CBSAs, 10 vendors, 130 wallets, 9.7% repeat ratio, 1594.9 sats/token claim density) are structurally stable, and the quiet-day trough is now in its third consecutive snapshot without deterioration."

Combined with zero new CBSAs, zero new vendors, and zero new payouts in 0.1h, this is a genuine quiet-day trough with no structural deterioration: all baseline metrics (14 CBSAs, 10 vendors, 130 wallets, 9.7% repeat ratio) are unchanged."

Daily cadence at 0.286x confirms a quiet-day trough, but the acceleration reading above 1.0x means the growth rate is still technically expanding, just barely. This divergence (velocity below 1.0, acceleration above 1.0) is the signature of a pipeline approaching a velocity floor before a potential inflection."

      "observation": "Token velocity is 0.8x week-over-week with daily cadence at 0.277x — today is running at roughly 1/4 of the weekly average daily pace. Acceleration is null (insufficient consecutive snapshots to compute), but the deceleration from prior 0.999x acceleration reading suggests the pipeline is in a genuine quiet-day trough, not a structural slowdown. Basket CV of 0.274 confirms the receipt mix is stable despite the throughput dip."

The cross-domain ratio (SaaS + physical in same window) is only 0.3%, meaning the two streams are growing in parallel but not yet from the same submitters."

The dataset spans grocery (Kroger, Publix, King Soopers), big-box (Walmart, Costco, Target), pharmacy (Walgreens), home improvement (Home Depot), coffee (Starbucks), and online (Amazon) — physical commerce is now the dominant receipt category by brand count."
