BTC price also moved from $65,513 to $67,352 (+2.8%), compressing sats/receipt from 153 to 148. The throughput trough may be bottoming."

Velocity is decelerating in absolute terms but the rate of change is still positive, a signature consistent with a pipeline approaching a throughput floor before a potential inflection."
