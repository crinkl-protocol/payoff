      "topic": "Lightning payout efficiency",
      "magnitude": "medium",
      "observation": "With 3,394 receipts submitted but only 144 Lightning payouts completed to 130 wallets, roughly 96% of receipts have not yet resulted in a Lightning claim — at 153 sats per receipt and BTC at $65,513, unclaimed value sits near 500M+ sats, suggesting either a significant redemption lag or that most submitters are not yet wallet-enabled."

      "magnitude": "medium",
      "observation": "In the 14-day window, King Soopers leads with 107 receipts versus Kroger's 84 — notable because King Soopers is a Kroger-owned regional banner concentrated in Colorado, suggesting the user base has a significant geographic concentration in the Denver/Front Range metro area (CBSA 19740)."

      "magnitude": "high",
      "observation": "The platform has processed $197,742 across 3,394 receipts, with the 14-day window alone representing $79,633 — roughly 40% of all-time GMV — meaning nearly half of total platform volume was generated in just the last two weeks, a strong signal of accelerating adoption rather than steady-state growth."

      "topic": "7-day average transaction value",
      "magnitude": "medium",
      "observation": "The single new receipt added to the 7-day window brought in $334.46 ($34,866.87 - $34,532.41), which is roughly 5.8x the current 7-day average of $57.92 per receipt — a notably high-value transaction that could be pulling the window average upward."

      "topic": "AI-native vendor clustering in DKIM signals",
      "magnitude": "medium",
      "observation": "Five of the nine DKIM vendors detected are directly tied to OpenAI or AI-adjacent platforms (OpenAI, tm1.openai.com, email.openai.com, Anthropic, Suno), suggesting the user base skews heavily toward early adopters of AI tools — a demographic signal that could inform targeting and partnership strategies."

      "magnitude": "medium",
      "observation": "The 'Unknown' category represents only 145 of 1,395 receipts (10%) in the 14-day window but accounts for $17,228 — an average of $118.81 per receipt versus $51.35 for grocery and $31.57 for restaurants — indicating a concentration of high-value transactions that are not yet categorized and warrant closer classification."

      "topic": "GMV and receipt velocity",
      "magnitude": "high",
      "observation": "The platform has crossed $197K cumulative GMV across 3,392 receipts, with the 14-day window alone accounting for $79,603 (40% of all-time GMV), suggesting the user base is either very new or experiencing a sharp acceleration in recent activity."

      "observation": "A modest increase of $23.49 in 14-day GMV and 1 additional receipt suggests steady, incremental growth in transaction volume and value over the two-week period."

      "observation": "Across cumulative, 7-day, and 14-day windows, the proportional increases in spend counts and GMV remain aligned, indicating stable average transaction sizes without major fluctuations in purchase behavior recently."
