      "observation": "Token velocity jumped to 0.69x (from 0.665x) with acceleration at 1.037x — the strongest acceleration reading since the plateau began. Combined with 19 new receipts in the window (3493→3512) and the 9-CBSA geographic burst, this snapshot shows the first simultaneous supply-side and demand-side acceleration since the quiet period started."

      "observation": "9 new CBSAs appeared in a single snapshot window — the largest single-pulse geographic expansion observed — bringing total active metros to 22 and geo-diffusion rate to 40.9%. The pulse sequence has been: 3 → 6 → 0 → 0 → 0 → 1 → 9, suggesting an accelerating burst pattern rather than steady-state growth."

      "observation": "Token acceleration ticked back to 0.999x (from 1.003x last snapshot) while velocity holds at 0.665x — the brief acceleration signal may not be sustained, but the plateau has not resumed either. The pipeline is in a transitional zone: not flat, not clearly recovering."

The pipeline is processing receipts without geographic or vendor expansion, suggesting existing nodes are deepening rather than spreading."

This may signal the end of the sustained plateau, though the move is small and needs confirmation across 2-3 more snapshots."

This is now a confirmed sustained plateau: the pipeline is holding steady without growth or decline, distinct from the prior deceleration phase.
