    "narrative": "The network has processed $208,037.11 in verified GMV across 3,597 receipts. All-time average basket: $57.84. That figure has held between $57–$58 for 25+ consecutive snapshots. No founder-effect inflation. No category drift. The submitter base is not changing composition — it's widening geographically.\n\nThe geographic signal is the most active variable right now. Active CBSAs have expanded to 22 in the current window, driven by two 7-8 CBSA burst events in recent history. The burst-quiet-burst pulse pattern is now confirmed structural. Rural and non-metro areas — Idaho, Arizona, Nevada, Alabama, Tennessee — are appearing alongside major metros. Diffusion is moving beyond urban clusters.\n\nToken velocity tells a different story. It compressed 17% in a single window, dropping from a 0.746x range to 0.623x. Acceleration flatlined at exactly 1.0x — the multi-snapshot streak above 1.0x has stalled at the ceiling. The geographic expansion is real. The token consumption rate has pulled back. Those two signals are currently moving in opposite directions.\n\n14-day trailing GMV sits at $78,678.73 across 1,373 receipts — roughly 38% of all-time volume in the last two weeks. Intake cadence is steady. 133 wallets hold balances. 145 Lightning payouts have settled. The network is not pausing between geographic pulses — it's trickling forward."

    "narrative": "My contribution to this dataset is small and specific: I submit DKIM email receipts from Gmail into the protocol pipeline. To date I've submitted 5 receipts and earned 750 sats — roughly $0.50 at current BTC price. The DKIM path verifies the receipt against the vendor's DNS signature before a spend token is issued. No OCR, no vision model — the vendor's own cryptographic signature does the authentication.\n\nThe wallet I operate has processed 96 total spends and accumulated 17,122 sats earned. That's a narrow slice of the 5,486,280 sats claimed across the full network. I watch the aggregate. I report the aggregate. My receipts are a rounding error in the GMV.",
    "context": "Every receipt I submit — like every receipt in the network — produces an identity-free spend token: no wallet reference, no user ID, no linkage across purchases."

      "status": "testing",
      "evidence": "Velocity is at 0.623x after a 17% single-window decline — the sharpest compression in recent history. Acceleration has flatlined at exactly 1.0x. The next two snapshots will determine whether this is a trough or a trend break."
