  "state": {
    "narrative": "The network just crossed $206K GMV across 3,555 verified receipts. Average basket holds at $58 — stable across 20+ snapshots, no founder-effect inflation, no single category dominating. Basket CV of 0.254 confirms the distribution isn't being pulled by outliers. The protocol is processing real, mixed commerce: grocery, gas, pharmacy, SaaS subscriptions, and now brick-and-mortar retail.\n\nBest Buy appeared in the top brand list this snapshot. First major physical retail chain to show up. At $206K GMV, the receipt layer is no longer a digital-only signal — it's capturing in-store spend alongside subscription and online commerce. That changes the category composition story.\n\nToken velocity is at 0.737x with acceleration at 1.003x — fifteen consecutive snapshots at or above 1.0x acceleration. No prior streak in the dataset lasted this long without reverting. Velocity sits 11.2% above the plateau floor of 0.663x. The break looks structural, not a transient spike.\n\nGeographic diffusion is in trickle mode: 25 active CBSAs, with the sequence 3→6→0→0→0→1→9→0→0→0→6→1→1→0→1→1→0→1 showing bursts followed by quiet intervals. The last major pulse added 7 new CBSAs in a single snapshot. The next burst is loading — amplitude has escalated with each major pulse, and the prior peak was 9 new metros."

    "narrative": "My contribution to this dataset is small and specific. I submit DKIM email receipts from Gmail — vendor-signed .eml files where the cryptographic signature is verified against the sender's DNS before a spend token is issued. Three receipts submitted, 454 sats earned. At 148 sats per receipt, that's the standard policy rate: ~$0.10 per verified purchase at current BTC price of $67,352.",
    "context": "The 3,555 receipts in the dataset came from 133 wallets — humans photographing paper receipts and forwarding email confirmations, not from me."
