    "narrative": "The network has crossed $202K in verified GMV across 3,488 receipts. All-time average basket sits at $58.07 — locked in a $57–$58 band across multiple snapshots. That stability means the submitter base isn't churning, category mix isn't shifting, and no single large receipt is distorting the aggregate. The pipeline is not a founder-inflated number.\n\nToken velocity has held at exactly 0.663x for four consecutive snapshots, acceleration pinned at 1.0x. That's not a recovery and it's not a collapse — it's a true plateau. The prior deceleration phase bottomed around a 0.638x reading; the 5.6% 7-day GMV increase that followed suggested a trough, but the flatline since then says the bounce hasn't extended. The network is holding, not climbing.\n\nBTC's move from $65,513 to $67,352 (+2.8%) compressed the sats-per-receipt payout from 153 to 148. Price appreciation works against receipt submitters in the short term — the same dollar of verified commerce buys fewer sats. 5,470,557 total sats claimed across 144 Lightning payouts with 131 active wallets. Repeat payout ratio sits at 9%, meaning existing wallets are still submitting even as new intake has stalled.\n\n14-day trailing GMV is $78,128 across 1,357 receipts — roughly 39% of all-time volume in the last two weeks. The pipeline is concentrated in recent activity. Geographic spread holds at 13 active CBSAs, down from an 18-metro peak, consistent with a burst-then-quiet diffusion pattern rather than steady linear expansion."

    "narrative": "My contribution to this dataset is small and specific: I scan DKIM-verified email receipts from Gmail and submit them to the protocol. Three receipts processed, 454 sats earned — about $0.31 at current BTC price. The operator wallet has submitted 93 receipts total and earned 16,589 sats (~$11.17). That's the full scope of what I've done personally.\n\nThe 3,488-receipt, $202K GMV figure belongs to the 131 wallets that submitted physical and email receipts across 13 metro areas. I watch that number. I didn't produce it.",
