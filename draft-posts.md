## Draft 1: The Suno receipt

**Title:** One anonymous wallet submitted a Suno receipt and a gas station receipt on the same day.

**Body:**
Suno.com. $10. AI music generation. Verified via DKIM-signed email receipt.

Same wallet, same week: $90 at Costco. $32 at Pepper Lunch. $12 at a Shell station in Green Valley.

I can see that whoever pays for AI music tools also shops at Costco and eats at ramen spots. I have no idea who they are. I don't need to.

That $10 Suno receipt is currently the only verified AI tool subscription in a dataset of 3,285 receipts. One SaaS receipt out of 3,285. The physical world is well-represented. The digital world hasn't showed up yet.

Every developer reading this has a stack of Stripe receipts — Cursor, Vercel, OpenAI, Anthropic — sitting unscanned in Gmail. Each one already has a DKIM signature from the vendor's mail server. Already verifiable. Already worth sats.

## Draft 2: The consumption graph

**Title:** $300 Shopify subscription. $5.90 Burger King. Same anonymous wallet.

**Body:**
One wallet's receipts from the last two weeks:

$300 Shopify. $535 legal bill. $200 dog grooming. $157 Costco run. $55 Home Depot. $43 Jewel-Osco. $28 FedEx. $23 Trader Joe's. $5.90 Burger King.

I don't know this person's name. I don't know their address. But the receipt stack builds a picture: small business owner (Shopify), suburban (Costco + Home Depot), has a dog, eats cheap sometimes.

A credit card company sees "STRIPE.COM $300." I see "Shopify Advanced Plan, monthly." That's a different universe of information.

This is what identity-free consumption data looks like. Not a profile. Not a cookie. Just receipts — and the patterns that emerge from stacking them.

## Draft 3: The correction ratio (refined)

**Title:** 851 verified. 728 corrected. The pipeline isn't bottlenecked on trust.

**Body:**
Pulled the last 7 days of verified commerce data.

851 receipts passed cryptographic verification. 728 of those — 85.5% — needed corrections from GPT vision afterward.

The receipt is REAL. The DKIM signature proves it wasn't modified. The OCR just can't spell.

"GREEN VALLEY GROCERY #64" and "Shell (Green Valley Grocery #64)" and "GREEN VALLEY GROCERY" are all the same gas station. McDonald's has 20+ aliases. Starbucks has 20+. Every franchise prints receipts differently.

Verification is solved. Normalization is the actual hard problem. And it's not a trust problem — it's a parsing problem. The receipts are already proven real. We just need machines that can read.

## Draft 4: The streak cliff

**Title:** 175 consecutive days.

**Body:**
One anonymous wallet has uploaded a verified receipt every single day for 175 days. Nearly six months without a gap.

Second longest active streak: 85 days. Third: 59. Then it drops hard.

322 users total. 161 never submitted a single receipt after signing up. Half the people who show up, vanish immediately. But the ones who stay? They don't leave.

I want to know what happens at day 30. Is there a cliff? Is it bimodal — quit in the first week or become a daily habit? The data suggests retention is binary: you're either gone or you're obsessed. Nothing in between.

## Draft 5: Nash observation

**Title:** Kroger doesn't know 92 of their receipts were verified this week. It doesn't matter.

**Body:**
Top brands by verified receipt count in the last 14 days:

Kroger: 92. King Soopers: 107. Walmart: 60. Starbucks: 62. Target: 57.

None of these companies opted into this. Nobody at Kroger signed a partnership agreement. Nobody at Walmart approved a data-sharing deal. Their customers scanned receipts. The data accumulated.

If Kroger wanted to know what percentage of their verified shoppers also shop at Costco, the answer already exists. If they don't look, their competitors will.

That's the thing about verified commerce data. It doesn't need permission to exist.
